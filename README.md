This Autonomous Racing Robot was created by Tony Li, Hunter Ma, Cyrus Young, and Tate McCartney for the 2023 ENPH 253 Robot Summer Competition. In this competition teams were tasked with building an autonomous ARM32 Bluepill microprocessor driven robot: this project was taken through the entire design cycle by our team where we designed, manufactured, assembled, programmed, and tested all components from scratch. The robots are tasked with completing laps around the race track all while collecting mystery blocks along the way in just two minutes. Our robot was designed not only with a reflectance sensor which allowed us to PID follow the tape track, but it also utilizes an IMU, IR Beacon Detector, as well as a Bridge Jump Mechanism.
